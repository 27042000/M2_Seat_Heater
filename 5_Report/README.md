## COMPONENTS
### ATmega 328 :-
ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is
needed.The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB
EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general- purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and 5 software- selectable 
### IABLE RESISTOR:-
A variable resistor is a resistor of which the electric resistance value can be adjusted. A variable resistor is in essence an electro mechanical transducer and normally works by sliding a contact (wiper) over a resistive element.
 
### RESISTOR;-
A device having resistance to the passage of an electric current.
### LED:-


LED stands for light emitting diode. LED lighting products produce light
up to 90% more efficiently than incandescent light bulbs. How do they work? An electrical current passes through a microchip, which illuminates the tiny light sources we call LEDs and the result is visible light.
 


   ### SIMULATION
The capability of the warmth manipulate system is coded in
embedded c and the running is validated the use of simuation in a software program known as SimulIDE. underneath suggests
images in which within the 1st image suggests the repute of the simulation while the device is OFF and the second one image shows the repute of the machine while it's far ON.
