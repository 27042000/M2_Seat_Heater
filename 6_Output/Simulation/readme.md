### In Action
#### Functionality 
* When the two switches are closed, the first LED glows indicating the actuation of the system and the heater.
* Next the analog input from the temperature sensor is received and digitized.
* The digitized temperature input is visualized using Pulse Width Modulation.
* The corresponding temperature values based on the digitized temperature input is transmitted by the UART protocol. Here the data is displayed on the serial monitor.
* Led connected at the potentiometer  terminal indicate the change in the resistance.
