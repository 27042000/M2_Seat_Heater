 ### Features
* The passenger's seating status and the Heater switch is shown using 2 switches.To indicate the success of this condition and to show Heater is ON, LED glows.
 *The sensing of the temperature is depicted with the help of a potentiometer.
* The analaog value from pot is converted to digital depending on the given limits with respect to voltage in terms of temperature.
* The output from this ADC in terms of PWM is shown in the oscilloscope.
* The data in terms of temperature is transmitted with the help of USART and shown in the Serial Monitor
* LED conected at the potentiometer terminal indicate change in resistance
